# Monty-Hall-Problem
Simulation to help demonstrate famous "Monty Hall" statistical problem

Imagine that you are on a game show and faced with a choice of three doors. Behind one of the doors is your dream car. Behind the other two, goats. 
You choose one door. The mischevious host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the two doors you did not pick and reveals a goat. 
You are then asked if you would like to change your choice to the door that has not been chosen or opened yet. Should you change?
